This file provides details on the tidy data set generated by the attached R script, run_analysis.R.

Details on the source data can be found in the README.txt file included in the download files (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The included R script, run_analysis.R reforms the following steps:

1) Read in the feature names from features.txt.  (561 variables)

2) Clean the feature names by removing dashes  and parentheses

3) Extract only features representing mean and standard deviation measures

4) Read in activity labels from activity_labels.txt

These include:
	
- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING
		
5) Read in test data from test/X_test.txt

6) Extract only those columns representing mean and standard deviation measures (86 variables)

7) Read in the list of test subjects corresponding to each reading

8) Read in the list of test activity labels and convert activity codes to appropriate label

9) Bind the test subject and activity labels to the test data

10) Read in the training data from train/X_train.txt

11) Extract only those columns representing mean and standard deviation measures (86 variables)

12) Read in the list of training subjects corresponding to each reading

13) Read in the list of training activity labels and convert activity codes to appropriate label

14) Bind the training subject and activity labels to the test data 

15) Merge the test and training data

16) Produce a new summary table by calculating the mean of each data column by activity and subject

17) Drop extraneous columns

18) Rename grouping columns to "Activity" and "Subject"

19) Export final tidy data table to CSV file in the working directory

The following provides an explanation of each column of the final tidy dataset:

- Grouping columns:
	- Activity - the activity being measured
	- Subject - the number of the human subject

- Data columns.  
	- All values represent the means of the source data values grouped by activity and subject.  Each data column can be interpreted from the column names using the following rules"
		- the single letter prefix indicates the domain
			- t = time
			- f = frequency
		- the second component of the name indicates whether the measure applies to the subject's body or to the component due to gravity
			- Body = subject's body
			- Gravity = component due to gravity
		- the third component of the name indicates the type of measure
			- Acc = linear acceleration
			- Gyro = angular velocity
